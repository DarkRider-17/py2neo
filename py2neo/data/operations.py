"""
This module contains functions used to carry out basic data operations
such as creating or merging nodes, as well as operations on full
subgraphs. Each operation typically accepts a transaction object as its
first argument; it is in this transaction that the operation is carried
out. The remainder of the arguments depend on the nature of the
operation.

Many of these functions wrap well-tuned Cypher queries, and can avoid
the need to manually implement these operations. As an example,
:func:`.create_nodes` uses the fast ``UNWIND ... CREATE`` method to
iterate through a list of raw node data and create each node in turn.

def create_nodes(tx, data, labels=None, keys=None):
    """ Create nodes from an iterable sequence of raw node data.

    The raw node `data` is supplied as either a list of lists or a list
    of dictionaries. If the former, then a list of `keys` must also be
    provided in the same order as the values. This option will also
    generally require fewer bytes to be sent to the server, since key
    duplication is removed.

    An iterable of extra `labels` can also be supplied, which will be
    attached to all new nodes.

    The example code below shows how to pass raw node data as a list of
    lists:

        >>> from py2neo import Graph
        >>> from py2neo.data.operations import create_nodes
        >>> g = Graph()
        >>> keys = ["name", "age"]
        >>> data = [
            ["Alice", 33],
            ["Bob", 44],
            ["Carol", 55],
        ]
        >>> create_nodes(g.auto(), data, labels={"Person"}, keys=keys)
        >>> g.nodes.match("Person").count()
        3

    This second example shows how to pass raw node data as a list of
    dictionaries. This alternative can be particularly useful if the
    fields are not uniform across records.

        >>> data = [
            {"name": "Dave", "age": 66},
            {"name": "Eve", "date_of_birth": "1943-10-01"},
            {"name": "Frank"},
        ]
        >>> create_nodes(g.auto(), data, labels={"Person"})
        >>> g.nodes.match("Person").count()
        6

    There are obviously practical limits to the amount of data that
    should be included in a single bulk load of this type. For that
    reason, it is advisable to batch the input data into chunks, and
    carry out each in a separate transaction.

    The example below shows how batching can be achieved using a simple
    loop. This code assumes that `data` is an iterable of raw node data
    (lists of values) and steps through that data in chunks of size
    `batch_size` until everything has been consumed.

        >>> from itertools import islice
        >>> stream = iter(data)
        >>> batch_size = 10000
        >>> while True:
        ...     batch = islice(stream, batch_size)
        ...     if batch:
        ...         create_nodes(g.auto(), batch, labels={"Person"})
        ...     else:
        ...         break

    There is no universal `batch_size` that performs optimally for all
    use cases. It is recommended to experiment with this value to
    discover what size works best.

    :param tx: :class:`.Transaction` in which to carry out this
        operation
    :param data: node data supplied as a list of lists (if `keys` are
        provided) or a list of dictionaries (if `keys` is :const:`None`)
    :param labels: labels to apply to the created nodes
    :param keys: an optional set of keys for the supplied `data`
    """
    list(tx.run(*unwind_create_nodes_query(data, labels, keys)))


def merge_nodes(tx, data, merge_key, labels=None, keys=None):
    """ Merge nodes from an iterable sequence of raw node data.

    In a similar way to :meth:`.create_nodes`, the raw node `data` can
    be supplied as either lists (with `keys`) or dictionaries. This
    method however uses an ``UNWIND ... MERGE`` construct in the
    underlying Cypher query to create or update nodes depending
    on what already exists.

    The merge is performed on the basis of the label and keys
    represented by the `merge_key`, updating a node if that combination
    is already present in the graph, and creating a new node otherwise.
    As with :meth:`.create_nodes`, extra `labels` may also be
    specified; these will be applied to all nodes, pre-existing or new.
    The label included in the `merge_key` does not need to be
    separately included here.

    The example code below shows a simple merge based on a `Person`
    label and a `name` property:

        >>> from py2neo import Graph
        >>> from py2neo.data.operations import merge_nodes
        >>> g = Graph()

    :param merge_key: tuple of (label, key1, key2...) on which to merge
    :param labels: additional labels to apply to the merged nodes
    :param keys: an optional set of keys for the supplied `data`
    """
    list(tx.run(*unwind_merge_nodes_query(data, merge_key, labels, keys)))


def create_relationships(tx, data, rel_type, keys=None, start_node_key=None, end_node_key=None):
    """ Create relationships from an iterable sequence of raw
    relationship data.

    The raw relationship `data` is supplied as a list of triples (or
    3-item lists), each representing (start_node, detail, end_node).
    The `rel_type` specifies the type of relationship to create, and is
    fixed for the entire data set.

    Start and end node information can either be provided as an
    internal node ID or, in conjunction with a `start_node_key` or
    `end_node_key`, a tuple or list of property values to ``MATCH``.
    For example, to link people to their place of work, the code below
    could be used:

        >>> from py2neo import Graph
        >>> from py2neo.data.operations import create_relationships
        >>> g = Graph()
        >>> data = [
            (("Alice", "Smith"), {"since": 1999}, "ACME"),
            (("Bob", "Jones"), {"since": 2002}, "Bob Corp"),
            (("Carol", "Singer"), {"since": 1981}, "The Daily Planet"),
        ]
        >>> create_relationships(g.auto(), data, "WORKS_FOR", \
            start_node_key=("Person", "name", "family name"), \
            end_node_key=("Company", "name"))

    If the company node IDs were already known, the code could instead
    look like this:

        >>> data = [
            (("Alice", "Smith"), {"since": 1999}, 123),
            (("Bob", "Jones"), {"since": 2002}, 124),
            (("Carol", "Singer"), {"since": 1981}, 201),
        ]
        >>> create_relationships(g.auto(), data, "WORKS_FOR", \
            start_node_key=("Person", "name", "family name"))

    As with other methods, such as :meth:`.create_nodes`, the
    relationship `data` can also be supplied as a list of property
    values, indexed by `keys`. This can avoid sending duplicated key
    names over the network, and alters the method call as follows:

        >>> data = [
            (("Alice", "Smith"), [1999], 123),
            (("Bob", "Jones"), [2002], 124),
            (("Carol", "Singer"), [1981], 201),
        ]
        >>> create_relationships(g.auto(), data, "WORKS_FOR", keys=["since"] \
